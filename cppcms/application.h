	///
	/// \brief application class is the base class for all user created applications.
	///
	/// This class is the base for all user actions required for web page generation.
	/// User application classes are created upon web page request and then cached in \a application_pool.
	///
	/// Applications can be bundled to hierarchies. You may add a sub application to hierarchy,
	/// and they will always be connected with topmost application and their lifetime would be binded to them.
	///
	/// application class is reference counted and may be used with \a intrusive_ptr. But reference count
	/// semantics is very different form an ordinary semantics for other classes derived from \a cppcms::refcounted.
	///
	/// 1.  All hierarchy share the counter of the topmost application. Thus, when all bundle is counted
	///     as a single unit allowing passing intrusive_ptr to itself to the central service safely.
	///     When the topmost application is destroyed, it destroys all its children application classes.
	/// 2.  When reference count goes to 0, the application is not destroyed but rather recycled to the 
	///     application pool for future use.
	/// 3.  The above hold only for synchronous applications, asynchronous one are destroyed when all 
	///     reference count goes to 0.
	///
	/// There two ways to add sub-applications to hierarchy:
	///
	/// 1.  Using member function family \a add, usually used with direct members of the parent class.
	///     Such child are not destroyed explicitly.
	/// 2.  Using member function family \a attach. The ownership on the application is moved to the 
	///     parent class and it destroys an attached class with delete.
	///
